Run the Coq Proof Assistant in your browser!
------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ejgallego/jscoq.svg?branch=js-worker)](https://travis-ci.org/ejgallego/jscoq) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/jscoq/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/jscoq/Lobby)

jsCoq is an Online Integrated Development Environment for the
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) proof assistant and runs in your browser!
We aim to enable new UI/interaction possibilities and to improve the
accessibility of the Coq platform itself. Current stable version is
jsCoq v8.9+0.8c supporting Coq 8.9, try it:

<https://x80.org/rhino-coq/>

JsCoq is written in ES2015, thus any standard-compliant browser should
work. Chrome (>= 48) and Firefox (>= 45) are reported to work OK,
jsCoq also runs in my 5-year old Galaxy Nexus.  Browser performance
is greatly variable these days, see the [Browser
Optimization](#Browser-Tips-and-Tricks) section if you have browser
problems.

Coq is compiled to javascript using the `js_of_ocaml` compiler. No
servers or external programs are needed.
We want to _strongly thank_ the `js_of_ocaml` developers. Without
their great and quick support jsCoq wouldn't have been possible.

**Note:** By default, the Coq standard libraries are qualified in jsCoq, thus
you need to prefix your imports:

```coq
Require Import Lists.
(* should become *)
From Coq Require Import Lists.
```

You should be able to tweak this behavior using an option, however,
due to the large number of packages bundled we recommend you write
qualified Coq imports.

### Browser Tips and Tricks

Browser performance is very variable these days, it is the case that
some jsCoq workloads work better in Firefox and some others work
better in Chrome. Browser performance seems to get better at every
iteration so we are hopeful about the future.

**Are you getting a `StackOverflow` exception?** We recommend
using the `--js-flags="--harmony-tailcalls"` command line flag in
Google Chrome; this setup greatly alleviates the problem. Firefox may
work better in this regard. Fiferox also seems to do better when
loading a lot of libraries is involved.

Older Google Chrome versions that don't use the Ignition engine
usually require the
[chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony](chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony)
flag enabled for heavy workloads.

**Warning for Chrome users:** be aware of privacy/DRM issues in Chrome
[bug
page](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=686430).
We recommend Chrome just for jsCoq, _not for other uses_.

## Development Version

Development for jsCoq 0.9 takes place in the `js-worker` branch. This
branch provides significant advantages due to Coq being ran in a
Worker thread. While the branch is not yet ready for general use, it
is the mandatory for developers. A preview build of jsCoq 0.9 is
usually available at:

<https://x80.org/rhino-coq/v8.9-js-worker/>

Be warned that the version uploaded to the link is quite unstable. Big
structural changes are happening in 0.9, please stop by gitter or by
the mailing list if you would to contribute. See below for build
instructions.

jsCoq is easy to develop using the Chrome developer tools; the jsCoq
object has a `debug` flag, and it is possible to compile Coq with
debug information by setting the makefile variable `JSCOQ_DEBUG=yes`.

Previous Coq versions can be accessed at:

- <https://x80.org/rhino-coq/v8.5/>
- <https://x80.org/rhino-coq/v8.6/>
- <https://x80.org/rhino-coq/v8.7/>
- <https://x80.org/rhino-coq/v8.8/>
- <https://x80.org/rhino-coq/v8.9/>

In the future, we may provide builds corresponding to particular git
hashes. See below for more jsCoq versions, including one adapted to
HoTT.

## Publications

A paper describing the ideas behind jsCoq 0.9 has been published in
the proceeding of the
[UITP 2016 workshop](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uitp/current/). The
paper is available from the open access
[EPTCS](http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/paper.cgi?UITP2016.2)
proceedings. The recommended citation is:

## Collacoq

A small pastebin-like server based on haste is available at
https://x80.org/collacoq

Note that this is totally experimental, and data loss is guaranteed.

See also the branch at https://github.com/ejgallego/haste-server/tree/collacoq

Help with Collacoq is very welcome!

## Troubleshooting ##

* Clearing the browser cache usually solves lots of issues.
* Consider using `--js-flags="--stack-size=65536"` in Chrome if you get `StackOverflows`.
* Use the `--js-flags="--harmony-tailcalls"` command line flag.
* Enable the `chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony` flag if you get `StackOverflows`.

## API / How to embed in your own webpage

JsCoq provides a `coqManager` javascript object for embedding Coq in
your particular application, blog, or webpage. The basic pattern to
add jsCoq to webpage with Coq code is:

```javascript
  <script src="$path/js/jscoq-loader.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    loadJsCoq($path).then( () => new CoqManager ($list_of_ids, [$options]) );
  </script>
```

where `$path` is the path the jsCoq distribution, `$list_of_ids` is
the list of textareas that will form the Coq document. See below for
available `$options`.

The jsCoq (landing webpage)[index.html] is a good actually running example.

### Options

JsCoq accepts the following options as an optional second parameter to
the constructor:

* `base_path`: Path where jsCoq is installed.
* `wrapper_id`: id of the div where to attach the panel.
* `all_pkgs`, `init_pkgs`: List of Coq's packages to show/preload.
* `prelude: bool`: Whether to load Coq's prelude or not.
* `implicit_libs`: Whether to make the initial libraries path implicit (that is to say, no `From Coq` etc... required)

## Homotopy Type Theory

jsCoq supports the HoTT library which requires a special build of Coq,
an online version is at: https://x80.org/rhino-hott/

## Examples

The main page includes a proof of the infinitude of primes by
G. Gonthier. We provide some more examples as a showcase of the tool:

## CoqDoc

A coqdoc replacement that is better suited to produce jsCoq output
while (mostly) remaining compatible is being developed at
https://github.com/ejgallego/udoc

It works kind of OK for converting coqdoc files, but it produces some
artifacts and omits some declarations.

There also is a superseded experimental version of coqdoc outputting
jsCoq at https://github.com/ejgallego/coq/tree/coqdoc

Just build coqdoc normally and use the option `--backend=jscoq`.

## Mailing List ##

You can subscribe to the jsCoq mailing list at:

https://x80.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/jscoq

The list archives should be also available through Gmane at group:

`gmane.science.mathematics.logic.coq.jscoq`

you can post to the list using nntp.

## Contributing ##

This is certainly an alpha-status project, but any contribution or
comment is really welcome! Please submit your pull request for review
to the mailing list using `git request-pull`. You can also submit a
github PR, but it is not guaranteed that we'll look into it.

## Reporting Bugs ##

Feel free to use the issue tracker. Please include your
browser/OS/user-agent and command line options.

## CodeMirror ##

[CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) has played a crucial role in the
project, we are very happy with it, thanks a lot!

Please consider supporting the development of CodeMirror with a donation.

## What is broken ##

* Loading ML modules is slow.
* Loading `.vo` files is slow.
* There surely are threading and performance problems.
* `vm_compute` and `native_compute` are devired to regular `compute`.

## How to Install/Build ##

You can download ready-to-use builds from
https://github.com/ejgallego/jscoq-builds/ ; find below the
instructions to build JsCoq yourself, it is reasonably easy.

Short instructions:
```shell
$ ./toolchain-setup.sh
$ make coq
$ ./build.sh
$ git submodule update --remote
$ npm install
```

For more detailed description and prerequisites, see docs/Build.md.

### Addon Packages:

  One of jsCoq's strengths is its support for bundling addon
  packages. In order to add your Coq package to jsCoq, you need to add
  a definition file in the `coq-addons` repository. We recommend you
  use one of the existing files as a model.

  Also, you need to define a jsCoq package by editing the
  `coq-tools/dftlibs.ml` file. Once that is done, calling `build.sh`
  and `make coq` should build your package.

## Serialization

JsCoq used to support serialization to Json or Sexps for Coq's
internal data structures, but this effort has been split to an
independent development. See https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi
for more information.

## Documents

See the `etc/notes/` directory for some random notes about the project.
