# JsCoq 0.11.1 "<-lib->'"
-----------------------------------------

 - Add "time" option that simulates Coq's command line `-time`
   (@ejgallego)

# JsCoq 0.11 "<-lib->"
-----------------------------------------

 - Project moved to https://github.com/jscoq/jscoq
 - Port to Coq 8.11 (@ejgallego)
 - Ltac2 is now built from the included Coq source and loaded by
   default by the init package (@ejgallego)
 - Primitive floats are available. Note that writing .vo files that
   use primitive floats is not possible from jsCoq; this is due to the
   js runtime representation for integers being already a float, so
   `Marshall` will be confused. Only writing `.vo` files is
   problematic tho, you can however use primitive floats normally, and
   load .vo files that where compiled with `coqc` using primitive
   floats normally (@ejgallego)
 - Enforce explicit module prefix in `Require` statements for non-Coq
   packages, to avoid ambiguity (@corwin-of-amber)
 - Init options for finer control of jsCoq's behavior: `show`, `focus`,
   `replace`, and `init_import` (@corwin-of-amber)
 - Line numbers continue across code snippets on the same page. Useful
   for `coqdoc`-generated pages (@corwin-of-amber)
 - Accept dropped `.coq-pkg` files as packages to add to the current
   session (@corwin-of-amber)
 - Allow multiple directories for package files (@corwin-of-amber)
 - More accurate error location marker (@corwin-of-amber)
